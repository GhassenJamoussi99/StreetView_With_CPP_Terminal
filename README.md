# StreetView_With_CPP_Terminal
I created a Simple CPP project that shows moving cars / buses / logs in the command prompt using windows library


## Created by :
 Ghassen Jamoussi

## Usage 
Download the project and run it in Visual Studio

## Note
The resolution of the game depends on my laptop. So if the game is buggy on your side, you need to adjust the resolution inside the main c++ program.
